# Analysis of U.S. Electric Fueling Stations

[WORK IN PROGRESS]

### What is this?

This is an analysis of electric fueling stations (AKA electric vehicle charging stations) in the United States.

I wanted to explore a few questions:
- How many EV charging stations are there in the U.S? Which states have the most?
- How many EV charging stations have opened in the last few years?
- In which states have EV charging stations opened at the fastest rate?

I sourced data to answer these questions from the U.S. Department of Energy Alternative Fuels Data Center: https://afdc.energy.gov/stations#/find/nearest?country=US. Specifically, I downloaded a CSV of alternative fuel charging stations data, using the API here: https://developer.nrel.gov/docs/transportation/alt-fuel-stations-v1/all/#csv-output-format.

### Visualizations

### So what?

Here's what I found:
